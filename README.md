Practical Machine Learning Repository

As described in the evaluation instructions, you will likely need to download my repository to evaluate the html version of my report.


Alternatively, I have also saved a <a href="https://github.com/dalezwart/pml-repo/blob/master/pmlReport.pdf">PDF version of the report</a> which may save you from needing to download the entire repository.
